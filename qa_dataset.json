The official Rainbow Loom kit has a much smoother and superior made loom and the hook is metal so will last.  It does however, cost twice as much as this kit but well worth it I think.  I merely bought this kit for the plastic storage box and extra loom bands as the Rainbow Loom kit comes in a cardboard box.  Hope this helps.","start_position":0,"end_position":610}

{"question":"Does this like tell u how to make any premade decks from the cards u get or just tips","answer":"there arent really any pre made decks, it gives you tips on things like how much land to have in your deck and it gives you ideas on which colours suit which playing styles and which colours go well together etc. Handy little leaflets on the rules and a huuuge assortment of different cards, if you wanted to, you could make 3 or 4 different effective decks out of these cards","start_position":0,"end_position":376}

{"question":"This or Core Set Fat Pack as a Starter? Not going to trade, just for family fun. Best options for most complete\/flexible start up, please. Thank you.","answer":"Honestly? Neither for family fun. I would suggest the duel decks or clash packs as that way you get 2 ready to play decks. If you want something to start a collection from, understanding you will need to buy more cards before being able to create any serious decks then this is slightly better than the fat pack. A decent deck typically has several copies of a few select cards in it rather than single copies of lots of different cards so whilst the deck builder kit starts a collection you wont have cards to make effective decks from right away.","start_position":0,"end_position":548}

{"question":"Me and my friend are looking at getting into this, is this good to build 2 decks out of to get cracking? Thanks!","answer":"Short answer is yes :) But only if playing each other from the pack. It comes with many cards and lots to test and play with. It is what I use it for as you can do 40 card decks if you want mono colours or for doubles do 40 or 60 card decks. However, the set comes with two cards at max of any card unless you are lucky. Thus, when playing with others whom collect you will loose as any deck made from this set is very luck based. Especially when they have four of some cards in their deck. I love just mixing cards and testing small strategies with this deck and it does add some good core cards to any collection. Hope this helps.","start_position":0,"end_position":632}

{"question":"Is it collapsible at all (for putting it away post-play)?","answer":"Hi Sarah,  I think it is meant to be left standing as you have to loosen the allan key screws to flatten the frame - I suspect this is to prevent the kids from flattening it and getting their fingers trapped.  When the fittings are tightened, the stand is very robust and secure.  Having said that, we now have to rotate toys due to lack of space, and the market stand does pack away easily.  The top just lifts off and rolls up, the slats just lift off the shelves and, using the allen key to loosen the fittings, the main frame does collapse.  So in answer to your question, if you keep the allen key close by and don't mind loosening and re-tightening it, then yes.  However, the stand looks so gorgeous with the crates of fruit and veg on it it is a shame not to have it on display.  Thanks,Cathy","start_position":0,"end_position":800}

{"question":"We've lost the instructions could anyone help tell us how to play.","answer":"Each jump has a number on it which is the dice roll to clear it. If a six is rolled you get one of the event cards (cleared\/faults\/not cleared etc). So, you set up the fences as you want them (using the 'jump numbers') on one side of the board (arena or cross-country) and each player has a horse and a 'spooked' card. Each player then gets a turn (youngest first). Using the timer to start: one rolls the dice over and over trying to get the number of that jump, and then onto the next. If you run out of time it's 4 faults extra (not a problem in our experience). If you get three 'refusal game cards' then you're out of the round. At any time, any player can use their spooked card and 'spook' i.e. make the rider repeat the previous jump. Once you've all had a go, a rosette is awarded, the board turned over and you all go again for the second round. Then you award a rosette for round 2 and a cup for the overall winner based on total points....and then you clean up the tweenager blood. (it's a horse thing that girls do). Good Luck.","start_position":0,"end_position":1040}

{"question":"how do I play this game","answer":"Take turns to roll the three die together. The dice with functions on tells you whether to add, subtract or multiply the two numbers showing on the other  die. So if you get  a 6 and an 8 and the function dice says multiply, then your score is 48. If the next player scores more than 48 he\/she wins a cupcake. If they score less than 48, you win the cupcake. If one of you throws an Aaahh, then you throw again and if it's another Aaahh, you lose that round. The first player to win all 3 cupcakes wins the game. If one player has two cupcakes and the other has one cupcake, you have to keep playing rounds until you can take the third cupcake from the other player.
